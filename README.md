# AIML_AWR_-Anomaly_Detection
The purpose of this Proof of Concept (POC) is to develop a mechanism for detecting anomalies within a specified time frame, addressing the challenges associated with continuous human observation for AWR data.


An RDBMS system consistently accumulates vast amounts of AWR data, capturing details such as session-specific SQLIDs, performance metrics, waits, and various other information. The manual monitoring of this data for anomalies becomes a daunting task due to its sheer volume, which holds true for other large-scale data systems as well. The purpose of this Proof of Concept (POC) is to develop a mechanism for detecting anomalies within a specified time frame, addressing the challenges associated with continuous human observation.
